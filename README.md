# Cardiovascular-Disease-Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard exploring the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance data from 2000-2018 provided by National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). It utilizes pure Python, including new libraries Holoviews and Panel. Project is based on Thu Vu's dashboard project (https://youtu.be/uhxiXOTKzfs).

Insights:
  1. Aside from heart failure, all other cardiovascular disease states have been trending downward since the early 2000s. The trend is surprising given how much emphasis cardiovascular diseases are given in pharmacy school.
  2. In Texas, people over 75 were twice as likely to have a cardiovascular issue than those who were a decade younger.
  3. Black people had the highest incidence rate although white people followed closely behind.

Please download and run the jupyter notebook on your local machine. The png file is to show one example of how the dashboard appears.
